**Title**: "[D] Vector Search for AI Agent Memory: LanceDB + OpenAI Architecture Case Study"

**Content**:
We built semantic search across 20+ AI agent workspaces using LanceDB and OpenAI embeddings. Some interesting findings on performance and implementation:

**Technical Details**:
- 780 indexed chunks from 27 agent workspaces
- text-embedding-3-small for vector generation ($0.08 total cost)
- <100ms average query time on local storage
- Agent-specific filtering with similarity scoring
- Automatic reindexing pipeline

**Use Case**: Finding relevant conversations across months of agent memory files, similar to how you might search academic papers or research notes.

**Open Source**: Full implementation details and code at [repo link]
