**Issue #228 - Social Media Campaign Content**

### Tweet 1/10 - Hook
```
🧵 Thread: I was embarrassed showing clients my "AI management system"

It was just Discord channels. 20+ of them. 

So I built something better. Here's how Talon went from side project to professional dashboard: 👇

### Tweet 2/10 - Problem Setup  
```
The problem was real:
• Lost conversations in chat history
• No real-time agent status  
• Mobile Discord during client calls = 💀
• Zero cross-agent information discovery

I was running enterprise AI through a gaming chat app. Something had to change.

### Tweet 3/10 - Solution Introduction
```
Enter Talon 🦅 

A professional command center for OpenClaw agents:
✅ 20+ agents visible in one view
✅ Real-time status monitoring
✅ Semantic search across ALL memories
✅ Mobile responsive (actually usable!)
✅ Client-demo ready interface

3/10
```

### Tweet 4/10 - Technical Stack
```
The tech stack that made it possible:

Next.js 14 (App Router)
+ LanceDB (vector search)  
+ OpenClaw Gateway API
+ WebSocket real-time updates
+ One-click Render deployment

No external dependencies. No vendor lock-in.

#NextJS #LanceDB #WebSocket #OpenSource

### Tweet 5/10 - Feature Highlight 1
```
Game changer #1: Semantic Search

⌘K opens command palette
Type "pricing strategy" 
→ Instant results from 780+ memory chunks across all agents

What used to take 5 minutes of Discord scrolling now takes 10 seconds.

### Tweet 6/10 - Feature Highlight 2  
```
Game changer #2: Real-time Everything

Sessions appear/disappear in real-time
Agent status updates live
Cron jobs show actual status
WebSocket magic = professional software feel

No more "let me refresh the page"

```

### Tweet 7/10 - Client Impact
```
The client reaction was immediate:

"Wait, you BUILT this? This looks like enterprise software."

From apologizing for Discord to showcasing professional AI ops. 

The confidence boost alone was worth the build effort.
