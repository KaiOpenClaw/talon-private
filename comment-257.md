## 🚀 GitHub-Driven Development Sprint: Taking Action on CRITICAL Infrastructure Recovery

**Sprint Time:** Friday, February 20th, 2026 — 5:32 AM UTC  
**Action:** Beginning systematic resolution of critical deployment infrastructure

## 🔍 Current Status Verification

Reviewing all technical prerequisites and deployment automation to ensure we're ready for immediate execution once manual dashboard access is available.

### ✅ Verifying Deployment Readiness:
- Checking emergency automation script functionality
- Validating environment variable configuration  
- Testing build system status
- Confirming API service connections

### 🎯 Parallel Actions:
While this issue requires manual browser access, I'm also addressing:
- Related infrastructure issues (#264, #249)  
- High-priority technical debt that could impact deployment
- Development productivity improvements

## 📋 Next Steps:
1. Verify all deployment automation is production-ready
2. Address any technical blockers that could delay recovery
3. Work on related high-priority issues while waiting for manual deployment
4. Report back with comprehensive status and ready-to-execute solution

**Goal:** Have everything technically perfect and ready for immediate 10-minute deployment execution.
